    "Error in Python can be of two types i.e. Syntax errors and Exceptions. Errors are problems in a program due to which the program will stop the execution. On the other hand, exceptions are raised when some internal events occur which change the normal flow of the program. \n",
    "In Python, there are several built-in exceptions that can be raised when an error occurs during the execution of a program.\n",

    "### Advantages of Exception Handling:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Improved program reliability: By handling exceptions properly, you can prevent your program from crashing or producing incorrect results due to unexpected errors or input.\n",
    "    Simplified error handling: Exception handling allows you to separate error handling code from the main program logic, making it easier to read and maintain your code.\n",
    "    Cleaner code: With exception handling, you can avoid using complex conditional statements to check for errors, leading to cleaner and more readable code.\n",
    "    Easier debugging: When an exception is raised, the Python interpreter prints a traceback that shows the exact location where the exception occurred, making it easier to debug your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Disadvantages of Exception Handling:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Performance overhead: Exception handling can be slower than using conditional statements to check for errors, as the interpreter has to perform additional work to catch and handle the exception.\n",
    "    Increased code complexity: Exception handling can make your code more complex, especially if you have to handle multiple types of exceptions or implement complex error handling logic.\n",
    "    Possible security risks: Improperly handled exceptions can potentially reveal sensitive information or create security vulnerabilities in your code, so it’s important to handle exceptions carefully and avoid exposing too much information about your program."
