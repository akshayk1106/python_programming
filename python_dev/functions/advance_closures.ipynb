    "### <mark> When to use closures\n",
    "\n",
    "**Closures can be used to avoid global values and provide data hiding, and can be an elegant solution for simple cases with one or few methods.**\n",
    "\n",
    "However, for larger cases with multiple attributes and methods, a class implementation may be more appropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "All function objects have a __closure__ attribute that returns a tuple of cell objects if it is a closure function.\n",
    "\n",
    "**ALTERNATIVE TO CLASS:** Say you have a class that has two methods. In the Python programming language, a class always has the __init__ method. If you have just one more method besides it, an elegant solution would be to use a closure, instead of a class. Why? This increases readability of the code and even reduces work of the programmer. So, closures can be used to avoid the unnecessary use of class.\n",
    "\n",
    "**AVOID USE OF GLOBAL SCOPE:** Sometimes you might have variables in the global scope that are not used by more than one function. Instead of declaring the variables in global scope, you must think of using a closure. You can define them in the outer function and use them in the inner function. Closures can also be used to avoid the use of global scope.\n",
    "\n",
    "**DATA HIDING:** Have you thought about calling the inner function directly at any point of time? You cannot do it! The only way to access the inner function is by calling the outer function. Data hiding is an important use of closures."
